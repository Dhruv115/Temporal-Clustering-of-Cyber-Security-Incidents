# Temporal-Clustering-of-Cyber-Security-Incidents

## Overview
This project investigates and implements **temporal clustering techniques** to analyze cyber-security incident patterns. By processing timestamped incident data, the goal is to uncover **trends, attack campaigns, or recurring threats**. Temporal clustering provides valuable insights into how cyber incidents evolve over time, which can help in proactive defense strategies.

## Features
- Import and preprocess cyber incident data (timestamps, severity, type, etc.)
- Apply clustering algorithms (e.g., DBSCAN, K-Means, Hierarchical) tailored for time-based data
- Visualize clusters of incidents across timelines
- Evaluate clustering performance using appropriate metrics
- Extendable for different datasets and scenarios
